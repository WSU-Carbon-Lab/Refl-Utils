    "In this first method, we suppose that the index of refraction is a rank two tensor. Note that we will seamlessly transition between the standard index notation for tensors, and the dyadic notation. Let $n_{ij} = \\bar{\\bar n}$ be the second rank index of refraction tensor. If we suppose that this tensor is diagonalizable, then there exists primary components $n_{11}, n_{22}, n_{33}$ or, in a cartesian coordinate system, $n_{xx}, n_{yy}$, and $n_{zz}$, i.e.\n",
